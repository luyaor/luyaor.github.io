My research work during Ph.D. targets enhancing the testing and debugging of AI models and AI systems, through techniques such as program analysis, constraint solving, and domain-specific languages.
In addition to academic contributions, my work has successfully detected 50+ bugs in AI compilers and graph databases, and has been deployed in top-tier industrial companies.

During my undergraduate, I research on fork-based development in open source software community, improving collaboration and identifying redundancies by machine learning techniques. In addition to academic contributions, I have built a prototype of our research work for detecting duplicate issues on GitHub before GitHub officially launching this feature. My experience has received a “like” from GitHub CEO on Twitter.
Additionally, I have worked on program transformations and automated program repair, and developed an IntelliJ IDEA plugin named <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/347482364">GenPater</a>, which has been published on the JetBrains Marketplace.
